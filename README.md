This repository is the register of my introduction to Python for the future me.
As I started learning Python, I used the py4e study platform created from Prof. Dr. Chuck from University of Michigan. As I progressed through the units, I registered my programs and coding's ideas in .py files. Some of them might be simple,
some of them might be incomplete, some might have notes for the later and more experienced me to check it, and some migh even be wrong. But that's just how life is. 
As time goes by, I was introduced to many other python devs and creators, so my syntax writing was clearly modified, so was my way of confronting and solving problems. This is just a record, like an old photo in a drawer. 

This register is here to remind me that every path has its beggining. And everyone can begin a new journey, no matter their age and past. I was one of them, not once, not twice.
